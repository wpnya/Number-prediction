## Overall
- model was fitted on MNIST dataset. Score 0.95
- `dependences.py` file includes the array of useful pixels, which were gotten via VarianceThreshold
- 28x28 screenshot is taken every 50 pixels drawn
- didn't use the blur effect for screens, 'cause the losses were getting higher
## Demo

## Thoughts
- add screeshots of drawn numbers with labels in train sample (espesially 6s, 7s and 9s)
- make brush more like MNIST (probably the main problem)
