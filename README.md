## Overall
- Model was fitted on MNIST. Score 0.95
- dependences.py file includes the array of useful pixels
- 28x28 Screenshot is taken every 50 pixels
- Didn't use blur effect, because loss got higher
## Demo

## Thoughts
- Add some amount numbers screeshots with labels in train sample
- Make brush more MNIST like (probably the main problem)
